Hello world! ðŸ‘‹ 
===
Iâ€™m Minwu Kim, a graduate researcher at New York University Abu Dhabi, where Iâ€™m fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Keith Ross](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/keithross/). I also completed my undergraduate degree here, majoring in Computer Science. 

My research focuses on **reasoning with large language models (LLMs)**. I aim to enhance our understanding of the inherent characteristics of LLMs and develop methods to align and improve their reasoning capabilities in accordance with these unique traits. 

Previously, I worked in **computational social science**, exploring topics in **corporate finance** and **macroeconomics**. You can read more about my journey and why I pivoted to LLM research [here](/posts/unstructured/).  

For a detailed look at my background and experiences, feel free to check out my [CV](/files/MinwuKim_CV.pdf).  

If you would like to talk about research or potential collaboration, feel free to ping me at ***mwk300[at]nyu.edu*** :\)


Thoughts on the LLM
----

Having a machine that understands human language means a lot. I jotted down some thoughts about it. 

- **[LLM and Wittgenstein's Picture Theory](/posts/picture-theory/)**
  - The Picture Theory posits that the structure of the world parallels that of language. If a machine comprehends language, it is reasonable to consider it intelligent.
- **[Abilities of LLMs and Information Density in Language](/posts/information-density/)**
  - The capabilities of LLMs fundamentally stem from their training data. From this perspective, we can understand what LLMs excel at and where their limitations lie.
- **[From Unstructured to Structured - A Quatitative Breakthrough of Data](/posts/unstructured/)**
  - Between structured and unstructured data lies a tradeoff between the volume of information and its structure. LLMs, however, may serve as a breakthrough to overcome this challenge.
- **[Thoughts on Inference-time Compute](/posts/inferernce-time)**
  - Personal ideas on why and how to let the LLMs think more.

- **[OpenAI o1 & Recent Trend of LLMs](/posts/o1/)**
  - Some thoughts after playing with o1.
