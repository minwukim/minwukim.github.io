Hello World!
===
My name is Minwu Kim. I am a graduate researcher at New York University Abu Dhabi (advised by Prof. [Keith Ross](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/keithross/)), where I completed my undergraduate with a major in Computer Science.

My current research interests is on **reasoning with LLMs** and exploring their potential and limitations. Specifically, I am working on a data-purist approach that only relies on high-quality data and standard supervised fine-tuning to improve their reasoning ability.

I am also interested in computational social science, particularly at the intersection of financial economics and machine learning. I have worked on topics such as the unveiling the mechanisms of activist funds selecting their next targets, and the long-term impacts of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis on Korean elderly society.

You can find a more comprehensive overview of my experiences in my [CV](/files/MinwuKim_CV.pdf)

If you would like to talk about research or potential collaboration, feel free to ping me at mwk300@nyu.edu

Thoughts on the LLM
----

Having a machine that understands human language means a lot. I jot down some thoughts about it. 

- **[LLM and Wittgenstein's Picture Theory](/posts/picture-theory/)**
  - According to the Picture Theory, the structure of the world parallels that of language. If a machine comprehends language, it is reasonable to consider it intelligent.
- **[Abilities of LLMs and Information Density in Language](/posts/information-density/)**
  - The capabilities of LLMs fundamentally stem from their training data. From this perspective, we can understand what LLMs excel at and where their limitations lie.
- **[OpenAI o1 & Recent Trend of LLMs](/posts/o1/)**
  - Some thoughts after playing with o1.
- **[From Unstructured to Structured - A Quatitative Breakthrough of Data](/posts/unstructured/)**
  - Between structured and unstructured data lies a tradeoff between the volume of information and its structure. LLMs, however, may serve as a breakthrough to overcome this challenge.
