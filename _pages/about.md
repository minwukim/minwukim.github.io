Hello world! 👋 
===
I’m Minwu, a researcher at New York University Abu Dhabi, where I’m fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Keith Ross](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/keithross/). I also completed my undergraduate degree here, majoring in Computer Science. 

My research focuses on **LLM Reasoning**. Recently, I have been particularly interested in:

* Identifying and addressing the limitations of RLVR.
* Expanding capability to solve 'hard' problems (pass@k=0% problems) for LLMs ([link](https://github.com/rdi-berkeley/awesome-RLVR-boundary)).
* Compositional generalization & Creativity.
* Synthetic data that better capture the human cognitive process during reasoning.
* Test-time scaling methodologies that enable more effective reasoning and with longer memory.

Before that, I worked in computational finance as well, particularly in corporate finance and macroeconomics.  

Before that, I worked on a startup project.

<!-- Thoughts on the LLM
----

Having a machine that understands human language means a lot. I jotted down some thoughts about it. 

- **[LLM and Wittgenstein's Picture Theory](/posts/picture-theory/)**
  - The Picture Theory posits that the structure of the world parallels that of language. If a machine comprehends language, it is reasonable to consider it intelligent.
- **[Abilities of LLMs and Information Density in Language](/posts/information-density/)**
  - The capabilities of LLMs fundamentally stem from their training data. From this perspective, we can understand what LLMs excel at and where their limitations lie.
- **[From Structured to Unstructured - A Quantitative Breakthrough of Data](/posts/unstructured/)**
  - Between structured and unstructured data lies a tradeoff between the volume of information and its structure. LLMs, however, may serve as a breakthrough to overcome this challenge.
- **[Thoughts on Inference-time Compute](/posts/inference-time)**
  - Personal ideas on why and how to let the LLMs think more.

- **[OpenAI o1 & Recent Trend of LLMs](/posts/o1/)**
  - Some thoughts after playing with o1. -->
